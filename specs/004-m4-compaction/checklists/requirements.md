# Specification Quality Checklist: M4 — Compaction (core)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (three open questions are tracked as OQ-1–OQ-3; none blocks planning)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- As in M2–M5, the "Today" column and C5/C6 cite code locations to make the problem checkable; requirements stay
  behaviour-level. Accepted as the repo's spec style.
- Scope is compaction only (D-038); the original M4 features are backlog K1–K4.
